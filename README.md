# LinkBudgetAnalysis
This project aimed to determine the maximum viable distance for a system with a set omnidirectional transmitter power, carrier frequency, and an omnidirectional receiver. MATLAB simulation was used to compare the BER performance of two data transmission methods through a noisy channel. The data file was that of simulated raw radar data returns from a MIG-25 aircraft. After the original data was converted into symbols, an algorithm was developed and implemented using MATLAB to model the transition through an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. MATLAB is then used to generate the output image at the receiver during low and high noise conditions. Also, MATLAB is used to generate a plot of SNR vs BER. Then, a link budget for the system was created in Excel to analyze the performance of the system further.
