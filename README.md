# LinkBudgetAnalysis
This project aimed to determine the maximum viable distance for a system with a set omnidirectional transmitter power and carrier frequency along with an omnidirectional receiver. MATLAB simulation was used to compare the BER performance of two data transmission methods through a noisy channel.
